# QM1
Schrodinger's equation-> probability of quantum tunneling 

TO BE ADDED:
1. plasma manipulation
2. sympy solver for MeV needed for 90%> probability of transmission (POT)
3. nuclear fusion?????

QM1.1 is the most updated one; QM1.2 is the tester; QM1 is the beginning stages of the project. 
Running QM1.1 will return:

Element 1: hydrogen

Element 2: hydrogen

isotope: no

total kinetic energy used: 0.596847478473 MeV

probability of tunneling: 97.01730574269455%


Element 1: helium

Element 2: hydrogen

isotope: no

total kinetic energy used: 0.9240493150669999 MeV

probability of tunneling: 92.40756614247802%


Interactive sliders/inputs will be added for convenience
